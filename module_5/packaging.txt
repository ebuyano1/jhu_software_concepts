The Importance of Packaging in Software Engineering

Implementing a setup.py file transforms a collection of individual scripts into a formal Python package, 
which is a fundamental practice in software assurance and reproducibility. Packaging allows the project to 
be installed in "editable mode" (pip install -e .), which ensures that internal module imports 
(such as importing db.py into app.py) work consistently across different environments, regardless of the 
user's current working directory. By explicitly defining dependencies and metadata, we eliminate the common 
"it works on my machine" problem, allowing automated tools like uv or CI/CD pipelines to recreate the exact 
environment needed for secure execution. Furthermore, formal packaging centralizes the management of 
third-party libraries, making it easier to track vulnerabilities and ensure that all developers and deployment 
servers are using the same verified versions of critical software.
