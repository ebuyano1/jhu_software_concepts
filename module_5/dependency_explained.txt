Dependency Graph Analysis
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The dependency graph depicts a modular Three Tier application architecture with the app.py module at its core, 
since it is the presentation and routing hub for my Flask app. As an entry point into the overall application 
flow, app.py coordinates all high-level flows of control by calling upon query_data.py for analytical outputs 
and load_data.py for populating the database with data. The dependency graph illustrates that query_data.py 
serves as a critical logic intermediary between the app.py module and the low-level database access provided 
through the db.py module. Additionally, since dependencies on the external libraries required for db.py's 
operations, such as psycopg and python-dotenv, are isolated from one another; the database connection logic 
and the sensitive secret management necessary to connect securely to the database are isolated from the 
remainder of the application. The visualization also illustrates a strict one way flow of dependencies, 
thus preventing circular dependencies from forming and ensuring that the scraper (scrape.py) and data 
loaders remain decoupled from the web front-end application. This structure shows a clear separation of 
concerns and will help to reduce code complexity and improve the overall security posture of an application 
by isolating sensitive database operations from the rest of the app. Lastly, generate_answers_pdf.py 
demonstrates another layer of utility dependence on the reportlab library for creating printable documents 
from the processed data.
