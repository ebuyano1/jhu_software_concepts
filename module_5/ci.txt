Shift-Left Security via GitHub Actions

To ensure the long-term integrity of the application, I implemented a CI/CD pipeline that enforces security 
and quality gates before any code is committed. First, Pylint ensures that code quality remains high, 
failing the build if the score drops below 10. Second, Pytest confirms that all functional logic remains sound. 
Third, the pipeline automatically regenerates the pydeps visualization, ensuring that the architectural boundaries 
and dependencies are verified on every push. Fourth, a Snyk security scan is integrated to catch any known 
vulnerabilities in our third-party libraries or custom code. Finally, a strict Coverage check requires 100% 
test coverage, ensuring that no "shadow logic" is introduced without verification. This "Shift-Left" approach 
catches vulnerabilities during development rather than after deployment.
